    "\n",
    "LangChain is an open-source framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs), whether they run locally or via cloud APIs like OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ollama allows you to run LLMs locally on your machine (such as Llama 3, Mistral, or Phi-3) without relying on external APIs.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "langchain (core framework)\n",
    "\n",
    "langchain-ollama (for Ollama integration)\n",
    "\n",
    "langchain-openai (for OpenAI integration, if needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install Ollama: Download from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) and run `ollama pull <model_name>` (e.g., `ollama pull llama2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install LangChain: `pip install langchain langchain-community`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For vector stores and RAG, additional installs: `pip install chromadb` (for a simple vector store like Chroma) and `pip install sentence-transformers` (for embeddings).\n",
    "\n",
    "In code, use Ollama as the LLM like this:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Vector stores in LangChain are databases for storing and querying embeddings (vector representations of text). Popular ones include Chroma, FAISS, or Pinecone. RAG uses a vector store to retrieve relevant documents/context before generating a response, improving accuracy by grounding the LLM in external knowledge (e.g., from PDFs, web pages, or custom data).\n",

    "- Retrieval: Query the store for similar vectors.\n",
